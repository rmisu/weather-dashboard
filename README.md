# weather-dashboard

This project contains a weather dashboard which users can use to find the upcoming weather forecast for any city of their choice.

The upcoming forecast section contains a 5-day forecast that displays the date, visual icon showing the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity of the city of their choice.

One issue that still needs to be resolved is the daily forecast showing today's weather when a city is chosen.
This will be addressed in an upcoming update.
